In what ways are you holding yourself back?
What was the best part of my day?
What life lessons, advice, or habits have you picked up from fiction books?
Write about a mistake that taught you something about yourself.
What are some small things that other people have done that really make your day?
How did I see the hand of the Lord in my life today?
